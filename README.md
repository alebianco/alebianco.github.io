# About me

I'm a front end developer with more than 10 years of experience working on the Flash Platform to create Rich Internet Applications, Games and websites.
I'm particularly interested in game and mobile development and in general always looking for new challenges.

# Open source

I develop and maintain a series of open projects ranging from AIR extension, AS3 libraries and IntelliJ plugins.

You can get a full list from my [Github profile](https://github.com/alebianco?tab=repositories) but here's a list of the one I'm most proud of:
